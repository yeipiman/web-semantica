## Comments on the self-assessment

datasets were imported into OpenRefine with proper encoding settings, data was cleaned and transformed following best practices (normalized column names, standardized dates, removed errors), and all outputs were exported correctly (JSON operations file in "openrefine" directory, updated CSV files with "-updated" suffix in "csv" directory). The transformation process is fully reproducible using the provided JSON file, and the cleaned data is now properly prepared for RDF conversion as specified in the assignment objectives.
