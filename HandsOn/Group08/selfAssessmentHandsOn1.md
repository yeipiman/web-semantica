## 💬 Comments on the self-assessment
All required deliverables have been created and uploaded correctly.  
The datasets fulfill the mandatory requirements (R1–R4), and the application proposal is consistent with them.  
We could improve by adding small visual mock-ups of the interface in future assignments.  

Overall, the group successfully completed Hands-on 1 and prepared the data for RDF transformation in the next step.
