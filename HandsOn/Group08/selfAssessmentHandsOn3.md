## Comments on the self-assessment
Data cleaning and ontology development are complete.

We found a misunderstanding in the traffic dataset: it included travel time metrics, not weather data.
Therefore, the requirement was adjusted to focus on traffic congestion status instead of meteorology.

The ontology was updated accordingly, adding properties like :hasCongestionFactor and :hasTrafficState to reflect the new information derived from OpenRefine.
