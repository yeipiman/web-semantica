    <h2>Key Features:</h2>

    <h3>Destination Selector:</h3>
    <p>The user enters an address or a point of interest in Madrid.</p>

    <h3>Congestion Analysis:</h3>
    <p>The application consults the traffic intensity dataset to determine if the destination area is characterized by <strong>HIGH</strong>, <strong>MEDIUM</strong>, or <strong>LOW</strong> congestion on working days.</p>

    <h3>Smart Recommendation:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>If traffic is HIGH:</strong> The application will recommend using BiciMAD as the most efficient option. It will display a map centered on the destination, highlighting the nearest BiciMAD stations and hiding or dimming car parks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>If traffic is LOW:</strong> The application will recommend using a private vehicle. It will display the same map, but this time highlighting the nearby public car parks.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Card:</h3>
    <p>Clicking on a BiciMAD station or a car park will display its relevant details (address, spaces, etc.).</p>
