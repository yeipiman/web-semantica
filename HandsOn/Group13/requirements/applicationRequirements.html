  <title>Application Requirements Group13 — Animal Census</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
  <p>The app will display the number and type of pets (dogs, cats, etc.) registered in the city of Madrid.</p>
  <p>Users can filter the dataset by animal type, breed, and district/neighborhood of Madrid.</p>
  <p>The app will provide simple statistics such as “Top 5 most common breeds” or “Number of pets by district.”</p>
  <p>A map will show the distribution of pets across Madrid, with markers or heatmaps for neighborhoods.</p>
  <p>May include vet location or recommendation (still studying this part).</p>
  <p>Acceptance criteria: users should be able to understand in ≤15 seconds how many animals live in their area, what types they are, and compare with other areas of the city. Source and date of data must always be visible.</p>
  <p>Optional: notifications or alerts can be sent when new census data is published or when there are specific campaigns (e.g., adoption fairs).</p>

   <h2>Non Functional Requirements</h2>
  <p>The app should be easy to use and mobile-friendly, with a responsive design.</p>
  <p>Performance: statistics must load in less than 5 seconds for the introduced queries.</p>
  <p>Scalability: the system should be able to support at least 250 concurrent users.</p>
  <p>Security: personal data is never shown; only aggregated and anonymized statistics are displayed.</p>
  <p>Availability: service should be online 24/7 with 99% uptime.</p>

  <title>Application Requirements Group13 — Accidentality</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
  <p>The app will display traffic accidents registered in Madrid with location, date, and severity.</p>
  <p>Users can filter accidents by district, street, time of day, and type of vehicle involved.</p>
  <p>We are thinking of a display of a map showing the distribution of accidents across the city with heatmaps or markers.</p>
  

   <h2>Non Functional Requirements</h2>
  <p>Same as the previous dataset</p>
